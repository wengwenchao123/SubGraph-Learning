# Gman: A graph multi-attention network for traffic prediction

This is a PyTorch implementation of Gman: A graph multi-attention network for traffic prediction. We have embedded SGL into GMAN. Please follow the relevant guidelines to run the code.

## Table of Contents

* configs: training Configs and model configs for each dataset

* lib: contains self-defined modules for our work, such as data loading, data pre-process, normalization, and evaluate metrics.

* model: implementation of our model 

* pre-trained:  pre-trained model parameters

# Data Preparation

For convenience, we package these datasets used in our model in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OQYVddI5icsHwSVWtRHbqJ-xG7242q1r?usp=share_link).

Unzip the downloaded dataset files to the main file directory, the same directory as run.py.

# Requirements

Python 3.6.5, Pytorch 1.9.0, Numpy 1.16.3, argparse and configparser

# Model Training

```bash
python run.py --dataset {DATASET_NAME} --mode {MODE_NAME}
```
Replace `{DATASET_NAME}` with one of `PEMSD3`, `PEMSD4`, `PEMSD7`, `PEMSD8`

such as `python run.py --dataset PEMSD4`

There are two options for `{MODE_NAME}` : `train` and `test`

Selecting `train` will retrain the model and save the trained model parameters and records in the `experiment` folder.

With `test` selected, run.py will import the trained model parameters from `{DATASET_NAME}.pth` in the `pre-trained` folder.
