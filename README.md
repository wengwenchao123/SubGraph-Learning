# Let's Group: A Plug-and-Play SubGraph Learning Method for Memory-Efficient Spatio-Temporal Graph Modeling

## Module  
The SubGraph Learning method is located in the `SGL module` folder.

## Model  
We have integrated the SubGraph Learning method into the code frameworks of models such as `DDGCRN-main` to ensure fair comparisons.

## Running the Model  
Please refer to the `README` file in each model framework for instructions on setting up the environment and running the models.

## How to Use the SGL Method  
We have embedded the parameters for the SGL method into the model's parameters:  
- In `DDGCRN-main`„ÄÅ`DGCNet-main` and `GMAN`, the related parameter settings are in the `config_file`.  
- In `STAEformer`, the related parameter settings are in `model/STAEformer.yaml`.  
- In `STWave`, the related parameter settings are in `baselines/STWave/PEMS0X.py`.
- In `DGCRN-main`, the settings are in `main.py`.

To disable the SGL method, set `use_subgraph` to `False`.  
The parameters `memory_node` and `topk` control the number of subgraphs and the number of nodes in each subgraph, respectively.

## Dataset
The relevant datasets can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xEoy-mwHeql5Ew_mmdQMGn34019iI-4I/view?usp=sharing).  
The files are already named according to the models. To use a dataset, simply place the corresponding files into the appropriate framework folder.

- For `DDGCRN` and `DGCNet`, move the `data` folder inside `data_DDGCRN_DGCNet` to the root directory of both models.  
- For `GMAN`, move the `data` folder inside `data_GMAN` to the root directory of `GMAN`.  
- For `DGCRN`, move the `data` folder inside `data_DGCRN` to the root directory of `DGCRN-main`.  
- For `STAEformer`, move the `data` folder inside `data_STAEformer` to the root directory of `STAEformer-main`.  
- For `STWave`, move the `data` folder inside `data_STWave` to the root directory of `STWave`.
